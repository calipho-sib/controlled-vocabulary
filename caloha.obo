The epithelium of the respiratory segment of the nasal cavity is essentially the same as the epithelium lining most of the parts that follow in the conducting system. The olfactory epithelium lining the olfactory segment of the nasal cavity, like the epithelium of the respiratory segment, is also pseudostratified but contains different cell types: bipolar neurons olfactory cells, supporting or sustentacular cells, basal cells and brush cells. The mucous lining of the nasal cavity, including lining of the nostril (vestibule) and the olfactory mucosa.

It consists of the main olfactory bulb and the accessory olfactory bulb, involved in the detection of pheromones. The olfactory bulb is located inferior (bottom) of the human brain, while in most vertebrates it is the most rostral (front) region of the brain. The olfactory bulb is relatively small in humans compared to other vertebrates. Odor molecules are detected by the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. The signal transduction starts at the olfactory receptors present on the cilia of the sensory neuronal dendrites, covering the surface of the olfactory epithelium. The binding of the odor molecule triggers an electrical response and sensory signals to the olfactory nerve fiber. The olfactory nerve fibers pass through the plate of the bone and connect the epithelium to the olfactory bulbs of the brain." [HPA]

However, the function of the appendix is widely debated due to the apparent lack of importance, as judged by an absence of side effects following an appendectomy. One hypothesis is that the appendix constitutes a vestigial remnant of a once larger cecum, while another hypothesis suggests that it acts as storage for beneficial bacteria during times of illness."

The pyloric canal ends as the pyloric orifice, which marks the junction between the stomach and the duodenum. The orifice is surrounded by a sphincter, a band of muscle, called the pyloric sphincter. In classical anatomy, the stomach is divided into four sections, and the pylorus is the lower section of the organ that facilitates emptying the contents into the small intestine."

The DLPFC also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex. Cytoarchitecturally, BA46 is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, rostroventrally by the frontopolar area 10 and caudally by the triangular area 45 (Brodmann-1909).

These regions mainly receive their blood supply from the middle cerebral artery. With respect to neurotransmitter systems, there is evidence that dopamine plays a particularly important role in DL-PFC. DL-PFC is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, and to a variety of brain areas, which include the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex, including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is important for the storage of working memory in the processing and preparation of all forthcoming actions and includes the superior frontal and the dorsal middle frontal gyrus."

BA10 was originally defined broadly in terms of its cytoarchitectonic traits as they were observed in the brains of cadavers, but because modern functional imaging cannot precisely identify these boundaries, the terms anterior prefrontal cortex, rostral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar prefrontal cortex are used to refer to the area in the most anterior part of the frontal cortex that approximately covers BA10-simply to emphasize the fact that BA10 does not include all parts of the prefrontal cortex. BA10 is the largest cytoarchitectonic area in the human brain. It has been described as "one of the least well understood regions of the human brain".

def: "The nucleus raphe magnus, located directly rostral to the raphe obscurus, is afferently stimulated from axons in the spinal cord and cerebellum. This makes the magnus a likely candidate for part of the motor system; however, it seems to participate in the endogenous analgesia system. The magnus receives descending afferents from the periaqueductal gray, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamic area, parvocellular reticular nucleus and the prelimbic, infralimbic, medial and lateral precentral cortices . All of these brain areas influence the main function of the raphe magnus. The main function of the magnus is mostly pain mediation; in fact it sends projections to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to directly inhibit pain. The periaquiductal gray, the epicenter of analgesia, sends efferent connections to the nucleus raphe magnus in when it is stimulated by opiates (endogenous or otherwise). Electrical stimulation of the PAG produces analgesia, as well as administration of morphine to the PAG or n.r. magnus. The antinociceptic effects of electrical stimulation of the PAG can be blocked by administering naloxone, an opiate antagonist, to the n.r. magnus. All of this seems to indicate that the magnus is part of the endogenous opiate system, and acts to inhibit pain in the spinal cord." [UBERON:wikipedia]

Also, the pallidus receives afferents from the medial preoptic area, median preoptic nucleus and lateral paragigantocellular reticular nuclei . The pallidus has recently been shown to be involved in the activation of a fever as an immunoreaction. It has been implied that the preoptic area is constantly inhibiting the raphe pallidus, especially the rostral portion, with GABA. When the preoptic area receives immune signals from the body, the inhibition stops and the rostral portion of the raphe pallidus excites the intermediolateral cell column, which induces a fever . The raphe pallidus has also been known to mediate the tachycardia response, an extremely high heart rate known to be incited by emotional or psychological stress. Microinjections of a GABA-a antagonist into the raphe pallidus, induces an increased heart rate. Conversely, microinjections of muscimol, a GABA-a agonist, inhibit tachycardia in rats under air-stress stimuli. In both of these cases, GABA is mediating two different sympathetic responses, so clearly the nucleus raphe pallidus is a far more a complex nucleus than previously thought." [UBERON:wikipedia]

name: Reticulotegmental nucleus
def: "The tegmental pontine reticular nucleus (or pontine reticular nucleus of the tegmentum) is an area within the floor of the midbrain. This area is known to affect the cerebellum with its axonal projections. These efferent connections have been proven to project not only ipsilaterally, but also to decussate and project to the contralateral side of the vermis. It has also been shown that the projections from the tegmenti pontis to the cerebellar lobes are only crossed fibers. The n.r. tegmenti pontis also receives afferent axons from the cerebellum. This nucleus is known for its large amount of multipolar cells and its particularly reticular structure. The n.r. tegmenti pontis is topographically related to pontine nuclei (non-reticular), being just dorsal to them. The nucleus reticularis has been known to mediate eye movements, otherwise known as so-called saccadic movement. This makes sense concerning their connections as it would require a nucleus which receives and projects to the cerebellum to mediate that kind of complex circuitry. Also, behaviorally this makes sense as no one thinks about saccadic movements when scanning a room and the saccadic movements are not directly controlled by the cortex. The nuclei of the cerebellum are the most traditionally studied mostly because it is easy to see which nuclei degrade when the cerebellum is amputated. The neurons of the lateral reticular formation are very important for reflexes and the mediation of posture. It has been shown in cats that electrical stimulation of the reticular formation can make a standing cat lie down. Conversely if the cat is stimulated in an alternate spot it can make a lying cat stand." [UBERON:wikipedia]

def: "The medial dorsal nucleus (or dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus) is a large nucleus in the thalamus. It receives inputs from the pre-frontal cortex and the limbic system and in turn relays them to the pre-frontal association cortex. As a result, it plays a crucial role in attention, planning, organization, abstract thinking, multi-tasking and active memory. The connections of the medial dorsal nucleus have even been used to delineate the prefrontal cortex of the Göttingen minipig brain. By stereology the number of brain cells in the region has been estimated to around 6.43 million neurons in the adult human brain and 36.3 million glial cells, and with the newborn having quite different numbers: around 11.2 million neurons and 10.6 million glial cells. Lesions of the medial dorsal nucleus have been associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy." [UBERON:wikipedia]

It sends projections to the medial prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex, although there exist sparse connections to many of the afferent structures as well. The prefrontal cortical-hippocampal connection allows it to regulate neural traffic between them with changes in attentiveness, as well as contribute to associative learning, spatial route planning, resilience to stress and memory generalization."
